- **Calendar Integration**: Detects events in emails and creates calendar entries with natural language support
- **Advanced Search**: Searches across entire email history with semantic understanding
- **Personalization**: Adapts to your communication style with specific contacts

## üöÄ Getting Started 

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A Google Cloud Platform account with Gmail API enabled
- OAuth 2.0 credentials for the Gmail API
- Claude Desktop with MCP support

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bastienchabal/gmail-mcp.git
   cd gmail-mcp
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment using uv:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Step 1: Authenticate with Google

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable Google APIs:
   - [Enable the Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)
   - [Enable the Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com)
4. Configure the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent):
   - Select "External" user type
   - Add your email as a test user
   - Add all the [scopes](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/scopes) of Gmail and Calendar
5. Create [OAuth 2.0 credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials):
   - Choose "Desktop app" as the application type
   - Download the JSON credentials file and copy the Client ID and Client Secret

### Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop

1. Create or edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file in `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Claude`
2. Add the following configuration, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmail-mcp": {
      "command": "/<absolute-path>/gmail-mcp/.venv/bin/mcp",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "/<absolute-path>/gmail-mcp/gmail_mcp/main.py:mcp"
      ],
      "cwd": "/<absolute-path>/gmail-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/<absolute-path>/gmail-mcp",
        "CONFIG_FILE_PATH": "/<absolute-path>/gmail-mcp/config.yaml",
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "<your-client-id>",
        "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "<your-client-secret>",
        "TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY": "<generate-a-random-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- Replace `<absolute-path>` with the actual path to your gmail-mcp directory
- Replace `<your-client-id>` and `<your-client-secret>` with your Google OAuth credentials (previously generated in the json file)
- Optional : Generate a random encryption key with: `python -c "import os; from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`

The configuration is designed to keep sensitive data (client ID, client secret, and encryption key) in the Claude Desktop configuration file, while non-sensitive settings are stored in the config.yaml file included in the repository.

### Step 3: Use Claude Desktop
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Type a prompt like: "Please retrieve my last email"
3. Claude should automatically connect to the MCP server and ask you to authenticate to your Gmail account (creating the file tokens.json)

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Important Note on MCP

If Claude Desktop doesn't connect automatically (i.e. you do not see the tool icon underneath the prompt input), you can try:
- Restarting Claude Desktop
- Asking Claude to "Use the Gmail MCP server"
- Login to Gmail manually using one of these methods:

### Important Note on Authentication

1. **Authentication Problems**:
   - Run `python debug/auth_test.py` to test the authentication process with detailed feedback
   - Check that the token file exists at the project root
   - Verify that your Google Cloud Console project has the correct redirect URI configured
   - Make sure all required scopes are added to your OAuth consent screen
   - If you see "Scope has changed" errors, ensure that the `openid` scope is included in your OAuth consent screen
   - If you see "redirect_uri_mismatch" errors, add the exact URI shown in the error message to your authorized redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console
   - If the callback page doesn't load or process properly, check if port 8000 is already in use by another application

2. **Calendar API Issues**:
   - Make sure you've enabled the Calendar API in Google Cloud Console
   - Check that you've granted all the necessary scopes during authentication
   - Run `python debug/reauth_calendar.py` to re-authenticate with Calendar API scopes
   - Verify that `CALENDAR_API_ENABLED` is set to `true` in your environment variables

### Important Note on Calendar Integration

Calendar integration can be turned off in the configuration file. If you've previously authenticated with the Gmail MCP server and are now enabling Calendar integration, you'll need to re-authenticate to grant the additional Calendar API scopes. You can do this by:

1. Deleting the existing tokens.json file (if present)
2. Restarting the MCP server
3. Following the authentication process again

## üë§ Usage

The MCP server provides several tools that Claude can use:

### Email Tools
- `get_email_count`: Get the count of emails in your inbox
- `list_emails`: List emails from your mailbox
- `get_email`: Get a specific email by ID
- `search_emails`: Search for emails using Gmail's search syntax

### Calendar Tools
- `create_calendar_event`: Create a new event in Google Calendar
- `detect_events_from_email`: Detect potential calendar events from an email
- `list_calendar_events`: List events from your Google Calendar

You can ask Claude to use these tools by phrasing your requests naturally, such as:
- "How many unread emails do I have?"
- "Show me my recent emails"
- "Find emails from John about the project"
- "Get the details of my last email"
- "Add a meeting with the team at 3pm tomorrow"
- "Check if there are any events in this email"
- "What's on my calendar for next week?"

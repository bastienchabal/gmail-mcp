# Gmail MCP Server Project Overview

## Project Purpose

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Gmail, enabling Claude Desktop to access and intelligently interact with a user's Gmail inbox. The server acts as a bridge between Claude and Gmail's API, providing context-aware capabilities that go beyond simple email reading and responding.

## Key Features

- **Deep Email Analysis**: Reads not just the current email, but entire conversation threads and related emails to build comprehensive context
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Generates responses that consider the full history of communications with the sender
- **Intelligent Action Suggestions**: Analyzes email content to suggest calendar events, tasks, and follow-ups
- **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Provides Claude with the ability to search across the entire email history
- **Personalization**: Adapts responses to match the user's communication style with specific contacts

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **MCP Protocol Handler**: Implements the MCP specification to communicate with Claude Desktop
2. **Gmail API Client**: Handles authentication and communication with Gmail's API
3. **Context Builder**: Transforms raw Gmail data into rich, structured context for Claude
4. **Action Executor**: Implements various actions (reply, forward, schedule, etc.) that Claude can perform
5. **State Manager**: Maintains session state and handles persistence

## Technical Decisions

- **Python**: Chosen for excellent libraries for both Gmail API and web servers, plus readability and maintainability
- **MCP Python SDK**: Python implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using Ressources, Tools and Prompts system
- **uv Package Manager**: Faster package installation and dependency resolution compared to pip
- **Asyncio**: Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations and handling multiple concurrent requests
- **OAuth2**: Authentication flow for secure Gmail API access

## Core Capabilities

### Authentication
- OAuth2 flow with Gmail API
- Secure token storage
- Automatic token refresh

### Context Building
- Thread analysis for conversation understanding
- Sender history collection and analysis
- Communication pattern detection
- Entity extraction from emails
- Related email discovery

### Actions
- Smart email replies with conversation context
- Calendar event creation from email content
  - Automatic event detection from email content
  - Natural language parsing for event details
  - Direct calendar event creation with confirmation
  - Event links for easy access
- Task generation based on action items in emails
- Intelligent label application
- Draft creation with suggested content

### MCP Implementation
- Compliant with latest MCP specification
- Structured context providing
- Clear action definitions
- Comprehensive search capabilities

## Development Approach

The project will be built incrementally, starting with core infrastructure and basic functionality, then adding more sophisticated features. Testing will be integrated throughout the development process.

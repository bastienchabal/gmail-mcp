- Set up configuration management using environment variables and dotenv
- Implemented logging with configurable log levels
- Created a README.md with installation and usage instructions
- Set up dependency management with pyproject.toml

## Authentication Module (2023-05-15)

The authentication module has been implemented with the following features:

- OAuth2 flow for Gmail API authentication
- Secure token storage with optional encryption
- Automatic token refresh when expired
- State parameter verification for security
- Support for multiple API scopes

## MCP Server Implementation (2023-05-15)

The MCP server has been implemented with the following features:

- FastMCP-based server with MCP tools and resources
- Protocol version handling via built-in MCP mechanisms
- Basic message, action, and search capabilities
- Comprehensive schema definitions using Pydantic
- Error handling with detailed logging

## Migration from FastAPI to FastMCP (2023-05-16)

The project was initially implemented using FastAPI but has been fully migrated to FastMCP for the following reasons:

- FastMCP is the official SDK for building MCP servers
- It provides native support for MCP protocol primitives (resources, tools, prompts)
- It simplifies the implementation by handling MCP-specific endpoints and request/response formats
- It offers better integration with Claude Desktop
- It provides a more idiomatic way to define MCP tools and resources

The migration involved the following changes:

- Replaced FastAPI with FastMCP from the MCP Python SDK
- Converted HTTP routes to MCP tools and resources
- Adapted the authentication flow to work with FastMCP
- Implemented Gmail API tools using the FastMCP tool decorator
- Updated the project dependencies
- Removed custom MCP protocol handling code that's now handled by FastMCP
- Simplified the server implementation by leveraging FastMCP's built-in capabilities

## Dependency Management (2023-05-16)

The project has standardized on using `pyproject.toml` for dependency management:

- Removed `requirements.txt` in favor of a single source of truth for dependencies
- All dependencies are now defined in the `dependencies` section of `pyproject.toml`
- Installation is done via `uv pip install -e .` which uses the `pyproject.toml` file
- This approach follows modern Python packaging best practices (PEP 621)
- Documentation has been updated to reflect this change

## Email Processing Implementation (2023-05-17)

The email processing module has been implemented with the following features:

- Comprehensive email parsing that handles complex MIME structures
- Thread analysis to extract conversation history and participants
- Sender history collection to understand communication patterns
- Metadata extraction for rich context building
- HTML to plain text conversion for better readability
- Attachment detection and handling
- Support for multipart messages with nested structures
- Robust error handling for malformed emails

The implementation follows these design principles:

- Type safety with comprehensive type hints
- Clear separation of concerns between parsing, analysis, and context building
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- Efficient API usage to minimize quota consumption
- Robust error handling to prevent crashes

## Context Building Implementation (2023-05-17)

The context building module has been implemented with the following features:

- Email context builder that provides detailed information about the current email
- Thread context builder that analyzes conversation history and participants
- Sender context builder that provides insights about the sender's communication patterns
- Rich context objects that provide Claude with deep understanding of the email environment
- Automatic context building based on the current user state

The context builders are designed to:

- Provide Claude with rich, actionable context
- Enable deep understanding of email conversations
- Support intelligent response generation
- Facilitate relationship analysis
- Enable context-aware actions

## Design Decisions

### Authentication

- Used Google's OAuth2 flow for secure authentication
- Implemented token encryption using Fernet for added security
- Stored tokens in a JSON file for simplicity, but with encryption
- Used state parameter verification to prevent CSRF attacks
- Adapted the authentication flow to work with FastMCP's tool-based approach

### MCP Implementation

- Used FastMCP for its native support of the MCP protocol
- Implemented tools for Gmail API operations
- Created resources for providing context to Claude
- Used Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- Designed tools to be self-contained and focused on specific tasks

### Email Processing

- Used Python's email module for parsing, extended with custom logic for Gmail's specific format
- Implemented thread analysis to provide conversation context
- Created sender history collection to understand communication patterns
- Used regex for HTML to plain text conversion for simplicity
- Designed the processing pipeline to be modular and extensible

### Context Building

- Implemented context builders as FastMCP context_builder decorators
- Created rich context objects that provide Claude with deep understanding
- Designed context builders to work together to provide a comprehensive view
- Used Pydantic models for type safety and validation
- Implemented lazy loading to minimize API calls

## Configuration

- Used environment variables for configuration to follow best practices
- Implemented a flexible configuration system with sensible defaults
- Used dotenv for local development convenience

## Next Steps

1. Implement entity extraction from email content
2. Build semantic search for related emails
3. Implement communication pattern analysis
4. Create response templates system
5. Implement tone and style analysis
6. Add user communication style learning
7. Implement email actions (reply, forward, draft)
8. Add attachment handling
9. Create template-based responses
10. Implement follow-up suggestions

## Dependency Management Updates (2023-05-18)

### MCP Package Name Change

The MCP Python SDK package name has changed from `mcp-python-sdk` to simply `mcp`. This required the following changes:

- Updated `pyproject.toml` to use `mcp>=0.1.0` instead of `mcp-python-sdk>=0.1.0`
- This aligns with the official installation instructions from the MCP Python SDK repository

### Installation Issues with spacy and nltk

When installing the project dependencies, there were issues building the `thinc` package, which is a dependency of `spacy`. To work around this:

1. First install the MCP package separately: `uv pip install mcp`
2. Then install the rest of the dependencies: `uv pip install -e .`
3. If issues persist with `spacy` or `nltk`, they can be temporarily removed from the dependencies and installed separately later

This approach ensures that the core MCP functionality is available, even if some of the NLP dependencies have build issues on certain platforms.

## MCP API Updates (2023-05-19)

### Migration from context_builder to resource

The MCP Python SDK has evolved, and the `context_builder` decorator that was used in earlier versions is no longer available. Instead, the SDK now uses the `resource` decorator to provide context to the LLM. This required the following changes:

- Updated all `@mcp.context_builder()` decorators to `@mcp.resource("uri://{param}")` decorators
- Modified the function signatures to accept specific parameters instead of a Context object
- Changed the return type from `List[Dict[str, Any]]` to `Dict[str, Any]`
- Simplified the implementation by removing context extraction code
- Updated error handling to return error information in the response
- Renamed `setup_context_builders` function to `setup_resource_builders` to better reflect its purpose
- Updated module docstring to clarify that it's about resource builders, not context builders

This change aligns with the current MCP specification, which uses resources as the primary way to provide context to LLMs. Resources are application-controlled, meaning that the client application can decide how and when they should be used.

The key differences between the old and new approaches are:

1. **URI Pattern**: Resources require a URI pattern with parameters (e.g., `email://{email_id}`)
2. **Direct Parameters**: Functions receive the parameters directly instead of extracting them from a context object
3. **Single Return Value**: Functions return a single dictionary instead of a list of dictionaries
4. **Error Handling**: Errors are returned as part of the response instead of returning an empty list

These changes make the code more straightforward and align better with the REST-like nature of the MCP protocol.

### Changes to the FastMCP run method

The `run` method of the FastMCP class in the current MCP Python SDK no longer accepts parameters like `host`, `port`, `reload`, and `log_level`. This required the following changes:

- Updated the `main.py` file to call `mcp.run()` without any parameters
- Removed the custom server configuration that was previously passed to the `run` method

The recommended approach for running an MCP server is now to use the MCP CLI tools:

1. For development and testing: `mcp dev server.py`
2. For integration with Claude Desktop: `mcp install server.py`
3. For direct execution: `python server.py` or `uv run python server.py`

This change simplifies the server implementation but requires using the MCP CLI tools for configuration instead of passing parameters directly to the `run` method.

## Linting Configuration (2023-05-20)

To address linting errors related to import resolution, several configuration files have been added to the project:

1. **VS Code Settings**: Added `.vscode/settings.json` with Python-specific settings to help VS Code's Python extension find the imported modules.

2. **Pylint Configuration**: Added `setup.cfg` with pylint configuration to ignore import errors for external dependencies like `googleapiclient`, `mcp`, `pydantic`, and `dotenv`.

3. **Pyright/Pylance Configuration**: Added `pyrightconfig.json` to configure Pyright/Pylance (VS Code's Python language server) to ignore missing imports and use the virtual environment for type checking.

4. **Environment Variables**: Updated `.env` file to include `PYTHONPATH` configuration to help with import resolution.

These changes should resolve the linting errors related to import resolution without affecting the actual functionality of the code. The linting errors were occurring because the linter couldn't find the imported modules, even though they're installed in the virtual environment and the code runs correctly.

If linting errors persist after these changes, you may need to:

1. Restart VS Code to apply the new settings
2. Reload the Python extension
3. Select the correct Python interpreter (from the virtual environment)
4. Manually install the linting tools in the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   uv pip install pylint mypy
   ```

## Automatic Token Creation (2023-05-21)

To improve the user experience when starting the MCP server for the first time, automatic token creation has been implemented:

1. **Startup Authentication Check**: Added a check at server startup to see if the tokens.json file exists
2. **User Prompt**: If no tokens are found, the server automatically prompts the user to visit the Google authentication URL
3. **Token Path Standardization**: Modified the TokenManager to use tokens.json in the root directory by default
4. **Graceful Handling**: Added fallback mechanisms for missing configuration values
5. **Login Function Export**: Refactored the OAuth module to export the login function for direct use in the main module

This implementation ensures that:
- Users are immediately guided through the authentication process when they first start the server
- The tokens.json file is automatically created in the expected location
- The authentication flow is seamless and user-friendly
- The server can start even if some configuration values are missing

The changes were minimal and focused on improving the user experience without modifying the core authentication flow.

## OAuth Callback Server (2023-05-22)

To improve the OAuth authentication flow, a dedicated callback server has been implemented:

1. **HTTP Callback Handler**: Created a simple HTTP server that listens for the OAuth callback at http://localhost:8000/auth/callback
2. **Automated Browser Flow**: The server automatically opens a browser window and waits for the authentication to complete
3. **User-Friendly Response**: After authentication, the user receives a nicely formatted HTML page confirming success
4. **Seamless Token Creation**: The tokens.json file is automatically created once authentication is complete
5. **Thread-Based Implementation**: The callback server runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main application

This implementation addresses several key issues:

- Previously, users had to manually copy and paste the authorization code, which was error-prone
- The redirect URL (http://localhost:8000/auth/callback) wasn't being handled, resulting in a "page not found" error
- The authentication process wasn't user-friendly, especially for non-technical users
- There was no clear indication when the authentication was complete

The new implementation provides a seamless authentication experience:
1. When the server starts without tokens, it automatically initiates the authentication flow
2. A browser window opens with the Google authentication page
3. After the user authenticates, they are redirected to a local callback page
4. The callback page processes the authorization code and creates the tokens.json file
5. The user receives a confirmation message and can close the browser window
6. The MCP server continues running with the newly created tokens

This approach follows OAuth best practices and provides a much better user experience.

## OAuth Callback Server Improvements (2023-05-23)

The OAuth callback server has been enhanced with the following improvements:

1. **Port Availability Checking**: The server now automatically checks if the default port (8000) is available, and if not, it tries the next available port
2. **Socket Address Reuse**: Implemented socket address reuse to prevent "Address already in use" errors when restarting the server
3. **Dynamic Redirect URI**: The authorization URL is now updated with the actual port if the default port is not available
4. **Graceful Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for socket and server errors
5. **Server Shutdown**: The server now properly shuts down after processing the callback

These improvements address several issues:

- Previously, if port 8000 was already in use (e.g., by another application or a previous instance of the server), the authentication process would fail with an "Address already in use" error
- There was no automatic port selection mechanism, requiring manual intervention if the default port was unavailable
- The server didn't properly clean up resources after processing the callback
- Error handling was minimal, making it difficult to diagnose issues

The enhanced implementation provides a more robust authentication experience:
1. When the server starts, it automatically checks if the default port is available
2. If the port is in use, it tries the next available port (8001, 8002, etc.)
3. The authorization URL is updated with the actual port to ensure the callback works correctly
4. After processing the callback, the server properly shuts down and releases resources
5. If any errors occur, they are logged and displayed to the user with helpful messages

These changes make the authentication process more reliable and user-friendly, especially in environments where multiple applications might be using the same ports.

## OAuth Redirect URI Mismatch Fix (2023-05-24)

The OAuth callback server has been further enhanced to address the "redirect_uri_mismatch" error:

1. **Consistent Redirect URI**: Modified the code to use the exact redirect URI from the Google Cloud Console configuration
2. **Port Extraction**: Added functionality to extract the port from the configured redirect URI
3. **Clear Warning Messages**: Added detailed warning messages when the configured port is already in use
4. **User Guidance**: Provided clear instructions for users on how to fix redirect URI mismatch issues
5. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for OAuth-specific errors

The "redirect_uri_mismatch" error occurs when the redirect URI used in the authentication request doesn't exactly match one of the authorized redirect URIs configured in the Google Cloud Console. This is a security feature of OAuth to prevent certain types of attacks.

The key changes include:

- No longer modifying the redirect URI in the authentication URL when a different port is used
- Instead, providing clear warnings and instructions when a port mismatch is detected
- Guiding users to add the new redirect URI to their Google Cloud Console configuration
- Extracting the port from the configured redirect URI to ensure consistency

This approach respects the OAuth security model while providing a better user experience when port conflicts occur. Users now receive clear guidance on how to resolve the issue, rather than just seeing a cryptic error message.

The implementation follows OAuth best practices by:
1. Not attempting to bypass the redirect URI validation
2. Providing clear instructions for resolving the issue
3. Maintaining the security benefits of the redirect URI validation
4. Giving users the information they need to update their configuration

## OAuth Authentication Timeout and Infinite Loading Fix (2023-05-25)

The OAuth authentication process has been further enhanced to address timeout and infinite loading issues:

1. **Timeout Mechanism**: Added a configurable timeout to prevent the authentication process from hanging indefinitely
2. **Callback Processing Flag**: Implemented a flag to track when the callback has been successfully processed
3. **Multiple Authentication Attempts**: Added support for multiple authentication attempts with configurable retry limits
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Improved server shutdown to ensure resources are properly released
5. **Auto-closing Browser Window**: Added JavaScript to automatically close the browser window after successful authentication
6. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for timeouts, interruptions, and other failure scenarios

These improvements address several issues:

- Previously, if the authentication process got stuck, it would hang indefinitely, requiring manual intervention
- There was no way to detect if the callback was successfully processed
- The server would sometimes continue running even after the authentication process completed or failed
- Users had to manually close the browser window after authentication

The enhanced implementation provides a more robust authentication experience:

1. The authentication process now has a configurable timeout (default: 5 minutes)
2. If the timeout is reached, the process gracefully terminates with a clear error message
3. The system automatically retries authentication up to a configurable number of times (default: 3 attempts)
4. After successful authentication, the browser window automatically closes after 5 seconds
5. If all authentication attempts fail, the application exits with a clear error message
6. The server properly shuts down and releases resources in all scenarios

These changes make the authentication process much more reliable and user-friendly, especially in environments where network issues or other factors might cause the authentication to hang or fail.

## Authentication Debugging and Reliability Improvements (2023-05-26)

The authentication system has been further enhanced with improved debugging capabilities and reliability features:

1. **Type Handling Improvements**: Fixed type mismatches in the token manager and callback server
2. **Credential Validation**: Added validation of existing credentials at startup
3. **Automatic Token Cleanup**: Invalid tokens are now automatically deleted to prevent authentication failures
4. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Added detailed error logging and exception handling
5. **Authentication Debug Script**: Created a dedicated debug script to diagnose authentication issues
6. **Improved Callback Handling**: Enhanced the callback handling to be more robust against type errors

These improvements address several issues:

- Previously, type mismatches could cause authentication failures that were difficult to diagnose
- Invalid tokens would remain in the system, causing repeated authentication failures
- Error messages were often too generic to be helpful in diagnosing issues
- There was no easy way to debug authentication problems

The enhanced implementation provides a more robust authentication experience:

1. The system now validates existing tokens at startup and automatically cleans up invalid ones
2. Detailed error messages and stack traces are logged to help diagnose issues
3. The authentication debug script provides a step-by-step analysis of the authentication system
4. Type handling has been improved to prevent common errors
5. The callback server is more robust against edge cases and type errors

These changes make the authentication process much more reliable and easier to debug, especially in complex environments or when issues arise.

## Claude Desktop Integration Improvements (2025-03-07)

### Problem Identified
We observed that Claude Desktop was unable to effectively use the Gmail MCP server. The logs showed that Claude was connecting to the server and polling for resources and prompts, but never actually calling any of the Gmail tools. This was happening despite the MCP Inspector being able to use the tools successfully.

### Root Causes
1. **Lack of Guidance**: Claude Desktop had no prompts to guide it through the authentication and email access workflow.
2. **Insufficient Context**: The resources didn't provide enough information about the authentication state and next steps.
3. **Unclear Tool Descriptions**: The tool descriptions didn't explicitly state prerequisites or provide usage examples.
4. **Missing Status Resources**: There was no dedicated resource for Gmail account status that Claude could check.

### Implemented Solutions
1. **Added MCP Prompts**:
   - Created `authenticate_gmail` prompt to guide Claude through the authentication process
   - Added `access_gmail_data` prompt to explain how to use Gmail tools
   - Implemented `gmail_authentication_status` prompt to help Claude check authentication status

2. **Enhanced Authentication Status Resource**:
   - Improved the `auth://status` resource to provide detailed information about authentication state
   - Added next steps guidance for different authentication states
   - Included user information when authenticated

3. **Created Gmail Status Resource**:
   - Added `gmail://status` resource to provide information about the Gmail account
   - Included account statistics, label information, and authentication details
   - Added next steps guidance for error conditions

4. **Enhanced Tool Descriptions**:
   - Added prerequisites to each tool description
   - Included detailed return value documentation
   - Added example usage patterns
   - Provided more context about how tools relate to each other

### Expected Outcomes
These changes should enable Claude Desktop to:
1. Understand when authentication is needed
2. Guide the user through the authentication process
3. Check authentication status before attempting to use Gmail tools
4. Provide more context-aware responses based on the enhanced resources
5. Follow a logical workflow when accessing Gmail data

### Future Improvements
1. Create example workflows for common email tasks
2. Implement a guided authentication flow specifically for Claude Desktop
3. Add more prompts for specific email tasks like composing replies or searching for specific content
4. Enhance error handling with more specific guidance for Claude

## Additional Claude Desktop Integration Improvements (2025-03-07)

After implementing the initial improvements, we observed that Claude Desktop was still stuck in a polling loop, not proactively accessing resources or executing tools. We implemented additional changes to address this issue:

### Problem Identified
Claude Desktop was connecting to the server and seeing the available prompts and resources, but it wasn't taking any action to start the workflow. It was continuously polling for resources and prompts without accessing them or calling any tools.

### Root Causes
1. **No Default Prompt**: There was no default prompt that would be automatically executed when Claude connects.
2. **Prompts Not Actionable Enough**: The prompts provided guidance but didn't include explicit code examples that Claude could follow.
3. **No Comprehensive Status Resource**: There was no single resource that provided a complete overview of the server status and next steps.
4. **No Automatic Workflow Initiation**: There was no mechanism to automatically start the workflow when Claude connects.

### Implemented Solutions
1. **Added Default Prompt**:
   - Created a new `gmail_welcome` prompt that provides an overview of the available functionality
   - Set this prompt as the default prompt in the FastMCP application
   - This prompt is automatically executed when Claude connects

2. **Made Prompts More Actionable**:
   - Enhanced all prompts with explicit Python code examples
   - Added step-by-step workflows with code snippets
   - Included print statements to help Claude understand the results

3. **Added Comprehensive Status Resource**:
   - Created a new `server://status` resource that provides a complete overview
   - Included authentication status, Gmail status, and available functionality
   - Added explicit next steps based on the current state

4. **Improved Code Examples**:
   - Used `await mcp.resources.get()` and `await mcp.tools.method()` syntax
   - Added error handling and result processing
   - Included complete workflows from authentication to data access

### Expected Outcomes
These additional changes should enable Claude Desktop to:
1. Automatically start the workflow when it connects
2. Follow the explicit code examples in the prompts
3. Access the comprehensive status resource to understand the current state
4. Execute the appropriate tools based on the next steps

### Future Improvements
1. Implement automatic resource fetching when Claude connects
2. Add more detailed error handling in the prompts
3. Create specialized prompts for specific email tasks
4. Implement a mechanism to track the workflow state between requests

## Simplified Claude Desktop Integration (2025-03-07)

After implementing several improvements, we observed that Claude Desktop was still having issues with the MCP server. We decided to take a more direct approach by simplifying the implementation and focusing on making tool calls work reliably.

### Problem Identified
Claude Desktop was connecting to the server and seeing the available prompts and resources, but it was still getting stuck in a polling loop. The previous improvements didn't fully resolve the issue.

### Root Causes
1. **Complex Code Examples**: The code examples using `await` syntax might have been confusing Claude.
2. **Resource-First Approach**: Starting with resources instead of direct tool calls might have been problematic.
3. **Too Many Steps**: The workflows had too many steps, increasing the chance of Claude getting stuck.
4. **Lack of Direct Tools**: Some common operations required multiple steps that could have been combined.

### Implemented Solutions
1. **Simplified Prompts**:
   - Removed complex code examples and used simpler syntax
   - Focused on direct tool calls rather than resource access
   - Reduced the number of steps in workflows
   - Removed unnecessary print statements and explanations

2. **Added Direct Tools**:
   - Created `check_auth_status()` tool for directly checking authentication
   - Implemented `get_email_overview()` tool for getting a comprehensive email summary
   - These tools reduce the number of steps needed to accomplish common tasks

3. **Added Debugging Resource**:
   - Created `debug://help` resource for diagnosing issues
   - Included common problems and solutions
   - Added a simple test workflow for verifying functionality

4. **Streamlined Workflows**:
   - Created a "Quick Start" section with minimal steps
   - Focused on the most common operations
   - Reduced the complexity of code examples

### Expected Outcomes
These simplifications should enable Claude Desktop to:
1. Use direct tool calls without getting stuck in complex workflows
2. Get meaningful results with fewer steps
3. Access debugging information when issues occur
4. Follow a simpler, more direct path to accomplish tasks

### Future Improvements
1. Create even more direct tools that combine common operations
2. Implement automatic error recovery in tools
3. Add more debugging capabilities
4. Consider implementing a stateful workflow that guides Claude through the process

## Project Restructuring (2024-11-05)

We've restructured the project to centralize all MCP components into dedicated files:

1. **Centralized MCP Components**:
   - `gmail_mcp/mcp/tools.py`: Contains all MCP tools
   - `gmail_mcp/mcp/resources.py`: Contains all MCP resources
   - `gmail_mcp/mcp/prompts.py`: Contains all MCP prompts
   - `gmail_mcp/mcp/schemas.py`: Contains all Pydantic schemas used by resources

2. **Benefits of Restructuring**:
   - Improved organization and maintainability
   - Easier to find and modify MCP components
   - Reduced import errors and circular dependencies
   - Better separation of concerns

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Moved all tools from `gmail/client.py` and `auth/oauth.py` to `mcp/tools.py`
   - Moved all resources from various files to `mcp/resources.py`
   - Moved all prompts to `mcp/prompts.py`
   - Created a new `mcp/schemas.py` file for all Pydantic schemas
   - Updated imports and references throughout the codebase
   - Added fallback for dateutil import in context builders

4. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Kept original setup functions in their respective files for backward compatibility
   - These functions now do nothing as the components are set up in the centralized files
   - Updated `main.py` to use the new centralized setup functions

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Add more direct tools for common tasks
   - Create example workflows
   - Implement guided authentication flow
   - Add more comprehensive error handling

## Simplified Approach (2024-11-04)

After observing Claude Desktop getting stuck in loops when interacting with the Gmail MCP, we've implemented a simplified approach:

1. **Simplified Prompts**:
   - Removed complex examples with `mcp.tools` and `mcp.resources` syntax
   - Focused on direct tool calls (e.g., `check_auth_status()` instead of `mcp.tools.check_auth_status()`)
   - Eliminated nested code blocks and complex workflows

2. **Direct Tools**:
   - Added `check_auth_status()` tool for quick authentication checks
   - Added `get_email_overview()` tool to provide a comprehensive email summary in one call
   - Simplified tool descriptions and parameters

3. **Debugging Resources**:
   - Created `debug://help` resource with common issues and solutions
   - Added detailed troubleshooting steps for Claude Desktop integration
   - Included simple example workflows for testing

4. **Streamlined Workflows**:
   - Added "Quick Start" section with simple, direct steps
   - Focused on linear workflows without complex branching
   - Reduced the number of steps required to accomplish common tasks

5. **Observations**:
   - Claude Desktop seems to struggle with complex code examples
   - Direct tool calls are more reliable than resource access
   - Simpler prompts lead to more consistent behavior
   - Avoiding nested code blocks and complex logic improves reliability

6. **Next Steps**:
   - Monitor Claude Desktop behavior with simplified approach
   - Gather feedback on which patterns work best
   - Continue refining prompts and tools based on observations
   - Consider adding more direct tools for common tasks

## Project Cleanup (2024-11-06)

After centralizing all MCP components, we've cleaned up the project by removing unnecessary files and functions:

1. **Removed Files**:
   - `gmail_mcp/gmail/client.py`: All functionality moved to centralized MCP files
   - `gmail_mcp/mcp/server.py`: All functionality moved to centralized MCP files
   - `gmail_mcp/context/`: Entire folder removed as all context building functionality moved to centralized MCP files

2. **Removed Functions**:
   - `setup_context_builders()` from `gmail_mcp/context/builders.py`
   - `setup_oauth_routes()` from `gmail_mcp/auth/oauth.py`

3. **Benefits of Cleanup**:
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Eliminated confusion about where functionality is implemented
   - Simplified the project structure
   - Removed unnecessary backward compatibility functions

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Updated imports and references throughout the codebase
   - Ensured that all functionality is properly implemented in the centralized files
   - Updated documentation to reflect the changes

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Continue to refine the centralized MCP components
   - Add more comprehensive error handling
   - Implement additional features as needed

## Calendar Integration (2023-05-25)

To enhance the Gmail MCP server with calendar functionality, a comprehensive Google Calendar integration has been implemented:

### Calendar Tools Implementation

1. **Event Creation**: Implemented `create_calendar_event()` tool that allows Claude to create calendar events with the following features:
   - Support for both ISO format and natural language date/time parsing
   - Automatic duration calculation (defaults to 1 hour if end time not specified)
   - Optional fields for description, location, attendees, and color
   - Direct links to the created events in Google Calendar

2. **Event Detection**: Implemented `detect_events_from_email()` tool that analyzes email content to identify potential calendar events:
   - Uses regex patterns to identify event-related language
   - Extracts dates, times, and locations from email content
   - Combines date and time information to create datetime objects
   - Provides confidence levels for detected events
   - Returns structured event data ready for calendar creation

3. **Event Listing**: Implemented `list_calendar_events()` tool to retrieve upcoming events:
   - Flexible time range specification with natural language support
   - Search capabilities for finding specific events
   - Pagination support for handling large numbers of events
   - Direct links to each event in Google Calendar

### Design Decisions

1. **Natural Language Parsing**: Used Python's dateutil.parser for flexible date/time parsing:
   - Allows users to specify times like "5pm next wednesday" or "tomorrow at 3pm"
   - Falls back to ISO format parsing for precise datetime specifications
   - Handles a wide variety of date/time formats and expressions

2. **Event Detection Approach**: Implemented a multi-layered approach to event detection:
   - First looks for explicit event patterns (meeting, call, appointment, etc.)
   - Then searches for complete datetime expressions
   - Finally combines separate date and time entities if needed
   - This provides robust detection even in informal email content

3. **User Confirmation Workflow**: Designed the tools to require explicit user confirmation:
   - Event detection presents potential events to the user
   - Claude must ask for confirmation before creating events
   - This ensures users maintain control over their calendar

4. **Direct Links**: Added event_link generation for all calendar operations:
   - Every event includes a direct link to Google Calendar
   - Claude is instructed to always include these links when discussing events
   - This provides users with easy access to view and edit events

### Documentation Updates

1. **Function Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings to all calendar tools:
   - Detailed parameter descriptions
   - Usage examples
   - Prerequisites and requirements
   - Return value documentation

2. **User Guidelines**: Updated the functions.md documentation with:
   - New section on Calendar Event Links
   - Guidelines for Event Detection and Creation
   - Example workflows for calendar integration

3. **Project Documentation**: Updated project.md and structure.md to reflect the new calendar capabilities

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Date/Time Parsing**: Handling the variety of ways dates and times can be expressed in emails required a flexible approach:
   - Implemented multiple parsing strategies with fallbacks
   - Added error handling to gracefully handle parsing failures
   - Used regex patterns to identify common date/time formats

2. **Event Title Extraction**: Determining appropriate event titles from email content:
   - Implemented pattern matching for common event-related phrases
   - Used subject line as fallback when no clear title is found
   - Added prefix to clarify when events are extracted from emails

3. **Type Safety**: Ensuring proper typing for optional parameters:
   - Used Optional[Type] for all optional parameters
   - Added proper error handling for None values
   - Fixed linter errors related to optional parameters

The calendar integration enhances the Gmail MCP server by allowing Claude to not only read and respond to emails but also manage the user's calendar based on email content, creating a more comprehensive email assistant experience.

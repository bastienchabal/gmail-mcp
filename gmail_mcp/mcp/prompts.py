# Gmail MCP Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Gmail MCP for Claude Desktop! This integration allows Claude to access and work with your Gmail account and Google Calendar, providing context-aware assistance for your email and scheduling needs.

## Getting Started

1. **Authentication**: First, you need to authenticate with your Google account.
   - Check your authentication status with `check_auth_status()`
   - If not authenticated, use `authenticate()` to start the process
   - After receiving the authorization code, use `process_auth_code_tool(code="your_code", state="your_state")`

2. **Email Operations**:
   - Get an overview of your inbox with `get_email_overview()`
   - List recent emails with `list_emails(max_results=10, label="INBOX")`
   - Search for specific emails with `search_emails(query="from:example@gmail.com")`
   - View a specific email with `get_email(email_id="...")`

3. **Context-Aware Email Replies**:
   - Prepare a context-rich reply with `prepare_email_reply(email_id="...")`
   - Create a draft reply with `send_email_reply(email_id="...", reply_text="...", include_original=True)`
   - After reviewing and confirming, send the email with `confirm_send_email(draft_id="...")`

4. **Calendar Integration**:
   - Create calendar events with `create_calendar_event(summary="...", start_time="...")`
   - Detect events from emails with `detect_events_from_email(email_id="...")`
   - List upcoming calendar events with `list_calendar_events(max_results=10)`

5. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If you encounter any issues, check the debug help resource: `debug://help`
   - You can also check the server status with `server://status`
   - For authentication issues, see the authentication guide: `gmail://authentication_guide`

# Gmail Authentication Guide

To use the Gmail MCP with Claude Desktop, you need to authenticate with your Google account. This guide explains the authentication process and how to troubleshoot common issues.

## Authentication Process

1. **Check Authentication Status**
   First, check if you're already authenticated:
   ```
   check_auth_status()
   ```

2. **Start Authentication**
   If not authenticated, start the process:
   ```
   authenticate()
   ```

3. **Complete Authentication**
   - A browser window will open with Google's login page
   - Sign in with your Google account and grant the requested permissions
   - After successful authentication, you'll receive an authorization code
   - Copy the authorization code and provide it to Claude:
     ```
     process_auth_code_tool(code="your_authorization_code_here")
     ```

4. **Verify Authentication**
   Check that authentication was successful:
   ```
   check_auth_status()
   ```

## Authentication Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser Doesn't Open**
   - The authentication URL will be displayed in Claude's response
   - Copy and paste the URL into your browser manually

2. **Authorization Code Invalid**
   - Make sure you copied the entire code without extra spaces
   - The code expires quickly, so use it immediately after receiving it
   - If it's expired, start the process again with `authenticate()`

3. **Permission Denied**
   - Ensure you grant all requested permissions
   - If you denied permissions, start again with `authenticate()`

4. **Already Authenticated**
   - If you want to switch accounts, first log out:
     ```
     logout()
     ```
   - Then start the authentication process again

5. **Token Expired**
   - Tokens automatically refresh, but if you encounter issues:
     ```
     authenticate()
     ```

## Security Information

- The Gmail MCP uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
- Your credentials are stored securely on your local machine
- You can revoke access at any time through your Google Account settings or by using the `logout()` tool
- The MCP only requests the minimum permissions needed to function

## Need Help?

If you encounter any authentication issues:
- Check the `auth://status` resource for detailed information
- Check the `debug://help` resource for troubleshooting guidance
- Try the `logout()` tool followed by `authenticate()` to restart the process

            "content": """
# Context-Aware Email Reply Guide

The Gmail MCP provides powerful tools for crafting personalized, context-aware email replies. This guide explains how to use these tools to create replies that consider the full context of your communication history.

## Understanding Context-Aware Replies

Context-aware replies take into account:

- The content of the original email
- The history of the conversation thread
- Your relationship with the sender
- Communication patterns between you and the sender
- Related emails and topics
- Entities mentioned in the email (dates, times, action items, etc.)

## Reply Workflow

### 1. Find the Email to Reply To

First, find the email you want to reply to:

```
# Get recent emails
list_emails(max_results=10, label="INBOX")

# Or search for a specific email
search_emails(query="from:example@gmail.com")
```

### 2. Prepare the Reply Context

Use the `prepare_email_reply` tool to gather comprehensive context:

```
# Replace with the actual email ID
reply_context = prepare_email_reply(email_id="18abc123def456")
```

### 3. Analyze the Context

The reply context includes:

- **Original Email**: The email you're replying to
- **Thread Context**: Information about the conversation thread
- **Sender Context**: Information about the sender and your history with them
- **Communication Patterns**: Analysis of how you and the sender typically communicate
- **Entities**: Important information extracted from the email (dates, times, action items)
- **Related Emails**: Other emails that provide additional context

### 4. Craft a Personalized Reply

Based on the context, craft a reply that:

- Matches the formality level of your previous communications
- Addresses all action items or questions
- References relevant history or related emails
- Maintains your typical response style with this sender

### 5. Create a Draft Reply

Use the `send_email_reply` tool to create a draft reply:

```
# Replace with the actual email ID and your reply text
draft_result = send_email_reply(
    email_id="18abc123def456",
    reply_text="Your personalized reply here...",
    include_original=True  # Whether to include the original email in the reply
)
```

### 6. ALWAYS Ask for User Confirmation

⚠️ **CRITICAL STEP** ⚠️

You must ALWAYS ask for the user's explicit confirmation before sending any email. This is a mandatory step:

```
# After creating the draft, show it to the user and ask:
"Here's the draft reply I've created. Would you like me to send it? If yes, I'll send it. If you'd like to make changes, please let me know."
```

### 7. Send Only After Explicit Confirmation

Only after receiving explicit confirmation from the user, send the email:

```
# Only after user confirms:
confirm_send_email(draft_id=draft_result["draft_id"])
```

## Always Include Email Links

When discussing or referencing emails, always include the direct link to the email in Gmail's web interface. These links are automatically included in the context:

- Email context includes `email_link`
- Thread context includes `thread_link`
- Each message in a thread includes its own `email_link`

Always display these links when discussing specific emails to allow the user to easily access them.

## Example: Analyzing Communication Patterns

The communication patterns analysis provides insights like:

- **Frequency**: How often you communicate with this sender
- **Response Time**: Your typical response time to this sender
- **Formality**: Whether your communications are typically formal or informal
- **Message Length**: Typical length of messages between you and the sender
- **Common Topics**: Topics that frequently appear in your communications

Use these insights to maintain consistency in your communication style.

## Example: Entity Extraction

The entity extraction identifies important information like:

- **Dates**: Mentioned dates that might indicate deadlines or events
- **Times**: Specific times mentioned in the email
- **Action Items**: Tasks or requests that require your attention
- **URLs**: Links that you might need to reference
- **Email Addresses**: Other people mentioned in the conversation

Address these entities explicitly in your reply to ensure a complete response.

## Tips for Effective Replies

1. **Match Tone and Style**: Use the communication patterns analysis to match your previous tone
2. **Address All Points**: Use the entity extraction to ensure you address all questions and action items
3. **Reference History**: When relevant, reference previous communications from the thread context
4. **Provide Context**: If referencing related emails, provide enough context for clarity
5. **Be Concise**: While being comprehensive, keep your reply as concise as possible
6. **Include Links**: Always include the email link when discussing a specific email
7. **Always Get Confirmation**: Never send an email without explicit user confirmation

## Important Reminders

1. **NEVER send an email without explicit user confirmation**
2. **ALWAYS include email links when referencing specific emails**
3. **Use the full context to craft personalized, relevant replies**
